# Assignment 1
I choose the shadertoy website https://www.shadertoy.com/ and found the solar flare model 4d Sun really cool. I was messing around 
with the different values and somehow changed the color to red. Pretty neat stuff, wish there was a better way to navagate the website to see more projects.
