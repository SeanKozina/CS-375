I really liked the idea of making a simple image viewer and using different user inputs for the various different actions available for the user. 
I think the user should be able to input an image and do the various actions necessary.


Week 1: I would like to find an appropriate web environment such as Three.js and get acquainted with it
Week 2: Create the canvas, import the models, and display them with perspective translation
Week 3: I would like to add some kind of animation in switching images and maybe have a few built in images that move (forest with wind)
Week 4: Prepare presentation
